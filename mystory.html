                          <br> 
                            In 2011, I was rescued from the grips of early marriage, a harsh reality faced by many in my culture. My journey began in a children’s home, where I found safety, support, and the opportunity to dream.
                            
                          <br> <b> The Challenge</b>
                            My father passed away in October 2007 after a long battle with an incurable disease. Losing him was devastating, and it left me feeling lost in a world that often felt against me. Early marriage was seen as a solution to many, but for me, it was a prison I had to escape.
                            
                          <br> <b> Finding Strength</b>
                            With the support of the children’s home, I discovered the power of education. It became my refuge and my path to a better future. Today, I am proud to be pursuing my degree, transforming my pain into purpose.
                            
                         <br>  <b> A Vision for Change</b>
                            I believe every child deserves the chance to experience the greatness of education. My journey has ignited a passion within me to help vulnerable children like I once was. I want to create opportunities for them to learn, grow, and thrive.
                            
                         <br>  <b>Call to Action</b> 
                            Join me in this mission. Together, we can empower children to break the cycle of early marriage and embrace the transfoative power of education. Your support can help us provide resources, mentorship, and hope to those who need it most.</p>
