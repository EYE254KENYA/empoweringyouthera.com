  <h2>STATISTICS</h2>
  <p class="description"> 
    In Kenya, single parenthood has seen a significant rise in recent years. According to the 2019 national census, 38.2% of families were headed by single parents, up from 25.1% in 2009. This increase is particularly evident in urban areas, where female-led households rose from 27% in 2014 to 31% by 2022. The trend is often attributed to factors such as teenage pregnancies, changing societal norms around marriage, and the economic independence of women.<br>
    The rise in single parenthood in Kenya reflects changing family dynamics and societal trends. As of 2019, 38.2% of families were headed by single parents, a notable increase from 25.1% in 2009. Much of this shift is linked to urbanization, economic independence, and societal acceptance of non-traditional family structures.

    Teenage pregnancies also contribute significantly to this phenomenon, with Kenya recording nearly 380,000 teenage mothers annually, highlighting the vulnerability of younger women to early motherhood. 
    
    Several experts, including family therapists, point to a growing reluctance among younger generations to marry, often preferring single parenthood due to dissatisfaction with traditional marriage roles and societal pressures.</p>
