  <h2>STATISTICS</h2>
  <p class="description"> 
    In Turkana County, deforestation is a significant issue, with substantial implications for the environment and local communities. Statistics indicate that a significant portion of Turkana's landscape lacks tree cover, leading to increased soil erosion and reduced biodiversity. In fact, approximately 90% of Turkana's land area is classified as arid or semi-arid, where the tree cover is critically low.<br>

    <br>Current Situation:
    - **Tree Coverage**: Turkana has one of the lowest tree cover rates in Kenya, with less than **5%** of its land covered by trees. This scarcity can be attributed to various factors, including overgrazing, charcoal production, and climate change.
    - **Biodiversity Loss**: The lack of trees contributes to habitat loss for many species, further decreasing the resilience of the ecosystem against climate impacts.<br>
    
    <br>Areas for Improvement:</br>
    1. <b>Agroforestry Initiatives</b> Encouraging agroforestry can help restore tree cover while providing economic benefits to local farmers. Integrating trees into agricultural systems not only supports biodiversity but also improves soil health.
      
    <br>2. <b>Community Education</b>: Engaging local communities in tree planting initiatives and educating them on sustainable land management practices can foster a sense of ownership and responsibility towards their environment.
      
    <br>3. <b>Government and NGO Partnerships</b> Collaborations between the government and non-governmental organizations can lead to the implementation of programs that promote tree planting and restoration of degraded lands.
      
    <br>4. <b>Use of Native Species</b> Focusing on planting native tree species can enhance the ecosystem's resilience and improve the soil's nutrient content.<br>
    
    <br> <b>Conclusion</b>:
    Addressing the lack of trees in Turkana requires a multi-faceted approach that combines community engagement, sustainable agricultural practices, and partnerships with organizations focused on environmental restoration. By taking these steps, Turkana can improve its tree cover, enhance biodiversity, and create a more sustainable environment for future generations.</p>
