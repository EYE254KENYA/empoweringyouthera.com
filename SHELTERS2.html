  <h2>STATISTICS</h2>
  <p class="description"> 
    In Turkana County, approximately **84%** of the population lives in informal or inadequate housing conditions. The 2019 Kenya Population and Housing Census indicated that many homes are constructed from substandard materials such as mud, thatch, or corrugated metal, which do not provide sufficient protection from the elements. 

Moreover, the challenges of limited access to clean water, sanitation, and basic infrastructure further exacerbate living conditions. The same census highlighted that many households lack essential services, which contributes to health issues and economic vulnerabilities. 

This situation reflects a pressing need for targeted interventions to improve housing quality, infrastructure development, and access to basic amenities in Turkana.</p>
