  <h2>STATISTICS</h2>
  <p class="description"> 
    Water scarcity is a critical issue in Turkana County, Kenya, largely due to its arid climate and recurring droughts. With an annual rainfall averaging only 200mm, far below the national average, the county has seen worsening droughts since 2020, significantly impacting its largely pastoralist population. Livestock, a primary source of livelihood, has been severely affected by the lack of water and pasture, leading to income and food security challenges for many households.

    Approximately 60% of Turkana's population lacks access to clean water, and in some areas, people walk up to 15 kilometers to fetch water, often from unclean sources like dry riverbeds. The scarcity has also resulted in high rates of malnutrition and waterborne diseases, particularly affecting women and children who bear the brunt of water collection duties.
    
     EYE is trying to reduce this by improving access to clean water through solar-powered boreholes and irrigation systems, benefiting thousands of households. However, more investment and development are needed to sustain these efforts and build long-term resilience.</p>
