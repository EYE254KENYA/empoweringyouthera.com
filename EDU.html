  <p class="description"> 
    The education rate in Turkana County has seen gradual improvement over the years, but significant challenges remain. Hereâ€™s a summary of the educational attainment statistics over recent years:

- <b>2009 Census: The literacy rate was approximately **20%**, highlighting a critical need for educational development.
- <b>2015: The primary school enrollment rate improved, with about <b>62%</b> of eligible children enrolled in schools.
- <b>2019 Census: The overall literacy rate increased to around <b>38.6%</b>, reflecting ongoing efforts to enhance education access and quality.

Despite these improvements, Turkana still faces barriers such as inadequate infrastructure, teacher shortages, and socio-economic factors that hinder educational progress. Further investments and targeted interventions are essential to continue this upward trend in education in the region.</p>
